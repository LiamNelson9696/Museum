# Museum

This is a project that I made for my CS211 class. It is a text-based menu that, if "Visitor" is selected takes in user information and stores each field into a seperate array. When the user selects "Museum Staff" and types the correct password, they are given a summary of all of the visitors. This summary is saved as a .txt file named after the date the user types.
