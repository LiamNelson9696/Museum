# Museum

This is a project that I made for my CS211 class. It is a text-based menu that, if "Visitor" is selected takes in user information and stores each field into individual arrays. When the user selects "Museum Staff" and types the correct password, they are given a summary of all of the visitors. This summary is saved as a .txt file named after the date the user types.

My professor, Kazumi Slott, provided checkInput.h to check if the user's inputs are valid. She also provided the template to the array.h file which I added to throughout the semester.
